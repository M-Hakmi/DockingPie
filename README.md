# DockingPie


    Introduction 
    
   
   
    Installation 
    
DockingPie runs on Windows, macOS and Linux (see Configuration for further details) and it is distributed freely to the public. 

DockingPie is installed, as any other PyMOL [1] plugin, via the PyMOL plugin manager:
•First download the latest version of the plugin ZIP file from the following link: https://github.com/paiardin/DockingPie 
•Launch PyMOL and use the Plugin → Plugin Manager command from the main menu of PyMOL. The plugin manager window of PyMOL will open.
•Click on Install New Plugin and press the Choose File… button. Select the DockingPie ZIP file which you have downloaded before. You will be asked to give the path of the directory in which to install the plugin files. Just select the default option if you are unsure about what to do (the location of the plugin files does not make any difference when running the plugin).

DockingPie has been developed and tested on official PyMOL builds distributed by Schrodinger (available at https://pymol.org/2/) and it is fully compatible with PyMOL 2.3 or higher. 

n.b. Some incompatibilities may arise with the usage of PyMOL version 2.5.x if ‘undo’ function is enabled, which in PyMOL 2.5.2 (latest version), still shows some shortcomings. Therefore, when the plugin is opened, the ‘undo’ function is automatically disabled and it is strongly suggested to keep it disabled when using the plugin.
